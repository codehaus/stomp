This delphi control implements a stomp client. In background it makes use of TClientSocket(under controls tab "internet" - ClientSocket). Because nonblocking TCP suited its original use better, so I have chosed this mode. 

The code for the control is in "source" directory. In "example" directory there is an straightforward example.

You may contact its author at pdvyuan@hotmail.com

Have fun!
