STOMPy, a STOMP client library for Python. It's very rough and ready but I 
hope it will be useful to someone. Released on 23rd September 2005 when 
the student project for which it was developed came to an end; further 
testing required!

* Distributed under the LGPL
* Works with ActiveMQ 3.1
* Doesn't handle receipts or errors
* Doesn't support concurrent connections
* Probably has other flaws and limitations
* Inspired by brianm's Ruby client revision #1, with apologies
