require 'stomp'

#
# This simple script is inspired by the netcat utility.  It allows you to send 
# input into this process to stomp destination. 
#
# Usage: catstomp (destination-name)
#
# Example: ls | catstomp /topic/foo
#   Would send the output of the ls command to the stomp destination /topic/foo
